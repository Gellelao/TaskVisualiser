# TaskVisualiser
Compare multiple tasks and their durations

Reads an input file written by the user, describing each task: what course it belongs to, and the start and end dates of the task.
A task is most often an assignment, but could be any named duration

Write dates in the form DD/MM, with no year.
If you want to use the current day, type "now"
