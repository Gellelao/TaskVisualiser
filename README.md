# TaskVisualiser
Compare multiple tasks and their durations

Reads an input file written by the user, describing a task on each line.
Lines should be in the format:

`[COURSE TITLE], [TASK NAME], ["from"], [DATE], ["to"], [DATE]`

Look at input.txt for an example

Write dates in the form DD/MM, with no year.
If you want to use the current day, type "now"
 - Note that this will update every day, so is not actually very useful

The colours are chosen randomly

The current day is highlighted in yellow

There is currently no error checking - the program assumes you have written the input file correctly
